<!--Compare and contrast the following 2 forms:
<form action="http://localhost:3002/send/" method="post"> ... </form>

<form action="https://dry-bayou-18746.herokuapp.com/send/" method="post"> ... </form>

Pay special attention to why one or the other won't work on github pages. Write a semantically formatted html file in q1.html that includes doctype, html, head, body, header, footer, main, h1 ("Post action attribute"), h2 ("http://localhost:3002/send/" and "https://dry-bayou-18746.herokuapp.com/send/") and p tags in the correct place. The paragraphs in the html file should contain whether each will work on github pages and why or why not.

Note: It is fine for you to just use the url of the action attribute in your level 2 headings.-->
<body>
    <main>
        <h1></h1>
        <p></p>
    </main>
</body>

<title>Question 1</title>

<!--Compare and contrast the following 2 forms:
<form action="http://localhost:3002/send/" method="post"> ... </form>

<form action="https://dry-bayou-18746.herokuapp.com/send/" method="post"> ... </form>

Pay special attention to why one or the other won't work on github pages. 
Write a semantically formatted html file in q1.html that includes
doctype, html, head, body, header, footer, main, h1 ("Post action attribute"), 
h2 ("http://localhost:3002/send/" and "https://dry-bayou-18746.herokuapp.com/send/") 
and p tags in the correct place. The paragraphs in the html file should contain 
whether each will work on github pages and why or why not.

Note: It is fine for you to just use the url of the action attribute in your level 2 headings.-->
<body>
    <main>
        <h1>Post Action Attribute</h1>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
                <h2>http://localhost:3002/send</h2>
                <p>Using localhost:3002 as the set location of the action attribute would not work for this HTML form. It would collect the submitted form-data and push it to a file that is local on the hostâ€™s computer. Therefore, it will not show up on a published GitHub page without the host manually updating the collected responses.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <h2>https://dry-bayou-18746.herokuapp.com/send</h2>
                <p> Since this page is publically accessible on the Internet, this web address acts as a direct server location for all the collected form-data into. On a Github page, the use of this action attribute in an HTML form would successfully work and send the collected form-data to the Heroku App platform.
